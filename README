linalg
===

Library for low-dimensional linear algebra written in Rust

Contains structs:
+ vectors with sizes 2, 3 and 4;
+ matrices with sizes 2, 3 and 4 of each dimension

TODO:
[x] determinant, matrix inversion
[ ] sqr, length of vector
[ ] component-wise multiplication of 2 matrices
[ ] map with lambda
[ ] logic ops for boolean vector
[ ] component-wise abs, sign and etc

To perform tests:
1. git checkout unittest
2. cargo test
